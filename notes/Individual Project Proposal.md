# Individual Project Proposal

- **Application Name**: Serve Your Nutrition Facts

- **Objective**: 

  The aim of this project is to help individuals manage their nutrition in order to prevent diabetes. It will provide customized personal nutrition facts and suggestions based on user input and their eating habits. This will be achieved through integration between the backend, powered by Google App Script, and the frontend, written in JavaScript, utilizing open API sources.

- **Solution Overview:**

  By integrating open-source APIs such as the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API documentation, FruityVice, and Chomp, the application will be able to provide valuable insights. Edamam will be used to analyze the nutrition content of foods inputted by the user, including details such as added sugars and calcium levels. FruityVice will focus on fruit-related nutrition facts, allowing users to visualize their daily calorie intake and assess whether they are consuming an appropriate amount. Chomp will provide diabetic exchange information, offering alternative food options based on user input. It's important to note that the number of APIs used may vary depending on the progress of development in the coming days. However, Edamam and FruityVice will be the primary focus of integration for Serve Your Nutrition Facts.
